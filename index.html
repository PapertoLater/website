			<h2>Disclaimers</h2>
			<p>It is possible that the paper article does not exist on the publisher's website. It is also possible that the publisher uses different titles, making it difficult to find. Please also note that currently, the API I use is limited to 10,000 per day. The service may be unavailable. Finally, if the article is behind a paywall (requires a subscription) to be read in digital version, neither I nor the application can do anything to change that.</p>
